In 2006, _"Weird Al" Yankovic_ released a track called _White & Nerdy_, a parody of the 2005 song _Ridin'_ by _Chamillionaire_ featuring _Krayzie Bone_.

In the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw) for _White & Nerdy_, Yankovic sings the lines:

```
I gotta business doin' websites,
When my friends need some code, who do they call,
I do HTML for 'em all,
Even made a homepage for my dog.
```

During the line `Even made a homepage for my dog.`, Al's nerdy persona shows off a website found at www.foofiethedog.com for his dog, Foofie.

I bought the domain "foofiethedog.com".

This repo contains the code for a remake of that website.
